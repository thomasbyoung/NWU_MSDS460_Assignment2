## **Overview**

This project looks at how network models and linear programming (LP) can improve project scheduling by optimizing resource allocation and reducing completion time. The implementation consists of a PuLP-based optimization model, a directed graph for task relationships, and both a desktop and web-based interface. Beyond the core optimization, I built interactive features to improve usability. A simple Tkinter GUI lets users adjust task durations, while a web-based version provides real-time forecasting using vanilla JavaScript. The assumption is that team members will log their hours, keeping project managers updated via a dashboard. A mock proposal (included in the same folder) outlines system capabilities and possible refinements for a hypothetical client. 

 DineWise is a prototype of the requested application. Although it meets core requirements (Alipine.js, Go, etc), it also currently runs on JSON files rather than a hosted Postgres DB. To fully test, signing up for Yelp Fusion app will be necessary. 

- **Project Schedule Optimization**: Uses **linear programming (LP) models** to optimize project timelines and minimize cost.
- **Restaurant Recommendation System**: Uses **Yelp GraphQL API** and **data analytics** to enhance restaurant discovery.

## **GenAI Tools**

### ðŸ”¹ **Use of Generative AI (GenAI)**

This project leveraged generative AI tools in the development process, particularly in brainstorming and debugging implementation details. In addition, generative AI played a role in drafting and refining project documentation. For example, these tools assisted in formatting this markdown document. The final work remains my own and using AI tools accelurated my productivity and ensured clarity.

AI used: Copilot, Claude, DeepSeekR1 (locally).
AI Logs: ./Logs/aiLogs.txt

## **Future Enhancements**

ðŸš€ **Possible Extensions Across Projects**

1. **Advanced AI for Project Scheduling**:

   - Train **machine learning models** for schedule estimation
   - Implement **Monte Carlo simulations** for uncertainty modeling

2. **DineWise Feature Expansions**:

   - **Personalized recommendations** based on past user interactions
   - **Sentiment analysis** of Yelp reviews
